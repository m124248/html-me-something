                <h2>Dogs!</h2>
                <p>I love dogs. I have had many dogs in my lifetime. My first dog was Hendrick. He was a Dutch Keeshond. My family got him
                    for christmas in 1996 when I was in the first grade. He was a very cute puppy. Now that I am grown up and own my own home,
                    I have a dog of my own. Her name is Lacey and I adopted her in August, 2017. She is some sort of shepherd mix. She barks at
                     the neighbors and herds the cats in the backyard.

                <h2>Cats!</h2>
                <p>I love cats. I have also had many throughout my life. My first cat was a tuxedo cat named Zoe my family adopted when I was 9. 
                    Zoe was actually a boy but the previous owners thought he was a girl. He was one cool cat. Today I have three cats because I am
                    insane and want to punish myself. NO! jk. I had two cats then a cat in need needed a home so I took him in. Things are definitely 
                    crazy around here but I wouldn't change it for the world.

                <h2>Sunny Days!</h2>
                <p>Don't you just love sunny days? It could be cold outside in the dead of winter, but if the sun comes out suddenly you
                    get a burst of energy. I get so much stuff done when the sun is out. It just gives you an all around good feeling. I love
                    laying out in the sun and feeling the warmth on my face. I'm not always good about wearing sunscreen, however.  
                </p>

                <h2>Going to Church!</h2>
                <p>I am Catholic born and raised. I recently read a book called <em>The Mass as Heaven on Earth</em>.
                     I love going to church each week to experience that "Heaven on Earth." Receiving God's grace feels like the warm sun on your face
                    or a cool drink of water on a hot summer day. Nothing compares.
                </p>

                <h2>Chatting with Old Friends!</h2>
                <p>I went the Naval Academy and because of this my closest friends live in different states. We keep in touch weekly by face timing
                    or just chatting over the phone. These conversations last well over an hour. I love my friends and miss them everyday! We make plans
                    to see each other in the future which gives us something to look forward to. 
                </p>

                <h2>Family!</h2>
                <p>I love my family! I moved back to STL to be closer to my family. We are very close and I have so much fun with them.
                    My parents are both one of 6 children so I have a large extended family. We are very blessed that most of us live in 
                    the area. I really missed them!

                <h2>Goin on Walks!</h2>
                <p>In my free time I love walking outside...with my dog of course! There is a nice park a few blocks north of us that we 
                    go to and I let her chase the squirrels. She hasn't caught one yet but that's ok; I don't think any less of her.

                <p>Who doesn't love good food! I don't eat meat or dairy so I get expecially excited when I discover a new recipe that's delicious AND plant-based! My current
                    favorite is homemade sweet and sour sauce on grilled tofu with rice and vegetables. <b>MMMM MMMMM!</b>
